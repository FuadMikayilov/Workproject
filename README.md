I used Console Application because Console applications are simple to set up and run, making them a good choice for unit tests that need to be executed quickly and easily.
Explanation WorkDayCalculator: This code is to calculate a final date based on the start date, number of days to add, and the weekends to exclude. The function takes three parameters: startDate, dayCount, weekends. The function starts by checking if the "dayCount" is less than 0 and throws an "ArgumentException" if that is the case. Then, if the "weekends" array is "null", it simply adds the "dayCount" to the "startDate" and returns the result. If the "weekends" array is not null, the code calculates the deadline date by adding "dayCount" to the "startDat"e and then loops over each" WeekEnd" object in the array. If the deadline date is greater than the "StartDate" of the "WeekEnd", it calculates the number of non-working days by subtracting the StartDate from the "EndDate" and adds it to the "dayCount". Finally, it returns the calculated date.
